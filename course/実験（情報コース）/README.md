# Robo-Comp-2022

A mobile robot developed by undergraduate students for autonomous navigation and task execution. This project demonstrates trajectory control and sensor integration for competitive robotics.

## Project Overview

The robot performs a complete autonomous mission sequence:
1. **Line Following** - 2-lap course navigation using 4 photo reflectors
2. **Garage Parking** - Precise 3-step parking maneuver with trajectory control
3. **Goal Search** - Wall-following and obstacle detection using PSD/ultrasonic sensors
4. **Button Press** - Automated manipulation with dual servo-controlled arm system
